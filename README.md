## Project Description

The purpose of this repo is to show and describe the process I went through to meet some needs of small business owner Julian Leon for his clothing brand, Twill the Messenger.

After many iterations of ideas, we agreed that his physical QR codes would link to a page that has links to all of his stories (think blog posts). I would make that page. 

That page was made by reworking Liquid in his Shopify shop via a developer account I created and Leon gave developer permissions to.

Now that this page has been created, Leon can leave his clothing at viewings with the QR code so that people can find out more information about what he does without him there.
